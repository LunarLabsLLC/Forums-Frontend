              We collect data about your contacts in order to fulfill a request by you, such as finding your contacts on the Service or inviting your contacts to join the Service.

        <p>
        We automatically collect information about your device and how your device interacts with our Service as well as your gameplay. We may use Service Providers to collect this 
        information. Some examples of information we collect include the following:
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          <b>Service Use Data: </b>
          We collect data about the features you use, the pages you visit, the e-mails and advertisements you view, the products you purchase, the time of day you browse 
          or use the Service, your referring and exiting pages and logins, and other similar information.
        </li>  
        <li>
          <b>Gameplay Data and Telemetry: </b>
          We monitor, record, and collect your in-game data including playtime, registration and login timestamps, player gameplay statistics (i.e. SW kills), currencies, 
          player owned kits and kit data, player preferences, login rewards and rewards streaks, owned, enabled, and selected cosmetics, ELO and ranked timeouts, and active amplifiers. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Device Connectivity and Configuration Data: </b>
          We collect data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, 
          and other similar information. This data also includes IP address, MAC address, device advertising ID (e.g., IDFA or AAID), and other device identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Location Data: </b>
          We collect data about your device’s location, which can be precise (e.g., latitude/longitude data) or imprecise (e.g., location derived from an IP address or 
          data that indicates a city or postal code level). 
        </li>     
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>We use various current – and later – developed technologies to collect this information (“<b>Tracking Technologies</b>”), including the following:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              <b>Log Files: </b>
              A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cookies: </b>
              A cookie is a small data file stored on your device that acts as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent 
              cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your 
              experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the 
              Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pixel: </b>
              A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, e-mail, or advertisements that sends information about your use to a 
              server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript 
              code). When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read 
              cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may 
              incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with 
              additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Device Fingerprinting: </b>
              Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript 
              objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>App Technologies: </b>
              There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by 
              browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the 
              app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such 
              as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Location-Identifying Technologies: </b>
              GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services 
              through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and 
              advertising based on that location.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and

          <p>Our Service contains content from and hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, and services operated and owned by third 
            parties (“Third Party Services”). These Third Party Services may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may 
            solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Service, a Third Party Service, a Third 
            Party Feature (defined below), or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share 
            with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to

          <p>We may allow you to connect our Service to a Third Party Service or offer our Service through a Third Party Service (“Third Party Features”).

             <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li><b>Liking, Sharing, and Logging-In.</b> We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Service that allows you to “like” or “share” content on, or 
            log-in to your MCCade account through, Third Party Services, including social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to engage

            (such as your user ID, billing information, public profile information, e-mail address, birthday, friends list, and other account and profile data). 
            Likewise, if you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Service or visit our Service while logged in to that Third Party 
            Service on your device, the Third Party Service may receive information about your activities on our Service and be able to associate that

            Privacy Policy. Also, if you publicly reference our Service on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with MCCade in a tweet 
            or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Service.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 className="font-bold text-neutral">C. Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising</h5>
            <p>
            Our Service contains Tracking Technologies owned and operated by Third Parties. For example, we use Tracking Technologies from third party 
            analytics provides, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service’s activity, 
            and provide us with other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other 
            third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third Party Services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our 
            Service and Third Party Services (including in e-mails and advertisements) to track your activities across time and services for purposes of 
            associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and Third Party Services or 
            third party devices after you have left the Service (<b>“Interest-based Advertising”</b>). 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
            We may serve ads on Third Party Services, such as Facebook and Google, that are targeted to reach people (or similar people) 
            on those services that have visited our Service or that are also identified in one of more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is 
            done by matching common factors between our data and the data of Third Party Services. If we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched 
            Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out. 
            We are not responsible for such Third Party Services’ failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.
