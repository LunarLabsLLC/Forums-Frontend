      <h4 className="font-bold text-neutral">Be kind to everyone</h4>
      <p>
      Do not call people names or try to bring someone down. If you think someone has done something wrong, you are allowed to say what they did and why you 
      think it's wrong in a positive and kind manner. Be the type of person you would want to encounter here. If you wouldn't want to be on the receiving-end 
      of a comment, then don't say it.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h4 className="font-bold text-neutral">Do not make pointless threads/posts</h4>
      <p>
      If the post/thread that you are about to write won't contribute in a positive way to the community but would only bring hate, then don't waste your 
      time on it. Instead, try to contribute to the positive changes which you'd like to see happen.          
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h4 className="font-bold text-neutral">Title threads appropriately</h4>
      <p>
      The title of your thread should be a summary of the content of it. Any thread that has a misleading title will result in a thread lock. If 
      you have feedback on something you don't like, don't bring hate to the title. Instead of "The New Update Sucks!!", title it something like 
      "Feedback on recent changes".
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h4 className="font-bold text-neutral">Do not generalize</h4>
      <p>
      If a Helper does something bad and you want to report it, say "a Helper named John54 is abusing their power". Do not say "MCCade staff are 
      abusing their power". This is extremely offensive to the hard working staff that follow the rules. If you encounter abusive staff members, 
      submit proof through a Support Ticket so that we can make sure the situation is dealt with. This applies to all negative generalization.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h4 className="font-bold text-neutral">Be constructive and positive</h4>
      <p>
      Your goal should always be to make MCCade a better place. If you have some feedback/criticism, you MUST think about how the problem could be 
      solved, and post some suggestions on what you think we could do. <b>All criticism MUST be accompanied by constructive suggestions on how it could be 
      fixed/improved.</b> Keep in mind that criticizing an idea is not the same as attacking someone's person. You can be honest and say you don't agree with 
      someone's idea, but just make sure that you're actually offering criticism and not falling into "ad hominem".
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Constructive criticism is the process of offering valid and well-reasoned opinions about the work of others, usually involving both 
        positive and negative comments, in a friendly manner rather than an oppositional one. Constructive criticism should not defame anyone or 
        hurt anyone's feelings.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h4 className="font-bold text-neutral">Do not spread hate</h4>
      <p>
      If you don't like something that has happened, please post it in a mature fashion. Do not make threads trying to convince other people of 
      how terrible something/someone is. Do not write long paragraphs about how much you hate something/someone. Your goal should be getting 
      problems solved in a fashion which is as efficient as possible. It shouldn't be to see how much attention you can get, or how many people you can 
      get to rally behind your cause. Please help us in creating an atmosphere where problems can be dealt with quickly, efficiently, and without added 
      drama or hostility.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h4 className="font-bold text-neutral">Do not be involved in drama</h4>
      <p>
      Drama will likely happen every once in a while. And when that happens, people tend to join in on the discussion and give their opinions on 
      the subject. Don't! It's simply none of your business to be involved in those dramas and it is likely to bring you punishments too. When you 
      notice something is not right, simply send a Private Message to one of the forums staff or admins. Let the staff resolve the issue.
