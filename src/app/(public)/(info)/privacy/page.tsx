              <b>Contacts: </b>
              We collect data about your contacts in order to fulfill a request by you, such as finding your contacts on the Service or inviting your contacts to join the Service. 
              Such functionality is only intended for United States (“U.S.”) residents. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are 
              based in the U.S. and that you have your contacts’ consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Content and Chat: </b>
              We collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions and information you provide to customer support. 
              We also collect the content of your communications as necessary to provide you with the services you use. For example, if you chat with another user through the Service, 
              we need to collect the content of that chat to display it to you and the other user as you direct.

        <p>
        We automatically collect information about your device and how your device interacts with our Service as well as your gameplay. We may use Service Providers to collect this 
        information. Some examples of information we collect include the following:
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          <b>Service Use Data: </b>
          We collect data about the features you use, the pages you visit, the e-mails and advertisements you view, the products you purchase, the time of day you browse 
          or use the Service, your referring and exiting pages and logins, and other similar information.
        </li>  
        <li>
          <b>Gameplay Data and Telemetry: </b>
          We monitor, record, and collect your in-game data including playtime, registration and login timestamps, player gameplay statistics (i.e. SW kills), currencies, 
          player owned kits and kit data, player preferences, login rewards and rewards streaks, owned, enabled, and selected cosmetics, ELO and ranked timeouts, and active amplifiers. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Device Connectivity and Configuration Data: </b>
          We collect data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, 
          and other similar information. This data also includes IP address, MAC address, device advertising ID (e.g., IDFA or AAID), and other device identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Location Data: </b>
          We collect data about your device’s location, which can be precise (e.g., latitude/longitude data) or imprecise (e.g., location derived from an IP address or 
          data that indicates a city or postal code level). 
        </li>     
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>We use various current – and later – developed technologies to collect this information (“<b>Tracking Technologies</b>”), including the following:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              <b>Log Files: </b>
              A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cookies: </b>
              A cookie is a small data file stored on your device that acts as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent 
              cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your 
              experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the 
              Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pixel: </b>
              A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, e-mail, or advertisements that sends information about your use to a 
              server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript 
              code). When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read 
              cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may 
              incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with 
              additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Device Fingerprinting: </b>
              Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript 
              objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>App Technologies: </b>
              There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by 
              browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the 
              app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such 
              as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Location-Identifying Technologies: </b>
              GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services 
              through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and 
              advertising based on that location.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and 
        services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on 
        the Service and certain Third Party Services.  
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>

        <h4 className="font-bold text-secondary">3. Information from Third Parties</h4>
        <p>
        We also obtain information about you from other third party sources. We protect data obtained from these third parties according to the practices described in this Privacy 
        Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third party sources vary over time, but may include:
