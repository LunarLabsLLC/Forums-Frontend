# Forums Frontend

Welcome to the LunarLabs's Forums repository! This project is an open-sourced frontend application based on the design of Cobra.gg's Forums. We originally developed this project for our own use, but due to unfortunate circumstances, we've decided to share it with the community. We hope it finds a new purpose and benefits others! This project depends on a backend API or else it will not WORK this was made to work with [Refine's API for Phoenix you can get it here by buying Phoenix and contacting Creaxx](https://discord.gg/refine-development-888463667895623812). We are actively working on making it work with Catalyst a RestAPI by @GrowlyX you can purchase Catalyst [here](https://discord.gg/sPwTAkGqKx)
